            A playground is a place where kids can play. Typically, they have playthings for kids to use, like slides, swings, and seesaws. A playground can improve your pavement surface and make your kids enjoy the playground more. Usually, they are outside, but occasionally, they are inside a building.

The playthings could be made of plastic, wood, or metal. If a youngster falls, the surface beneath the apparatus wonâ€™t be hard. You might find sand, woodchips, or a rubber floor there. You might find sand, woodchips, or a rubber floor there
